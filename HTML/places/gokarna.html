    <h1>Paradise beach</h1>
    <div class="paradise pimg"></div>
    <p>The fourth beach lying across the coast of Gokarna Town, Paradise Beach is also well-known by the name of 'Full Moon Beach'. Located in the state of Karnataka, the Paradise Beach is about 150 meters in length and out of this almost seventy percent of the beach is entirely covered in rocks. The rest of the beach is adorned with clean white sand all over. Not much water sports are available here but swimming in the calm waters here is a great way to refresh your mind and body. The serene environment of the beach offers a great opportunity to spend some time in nature's lap and find solace. Paradise Beach is not accessible by road and can only be reached via other beaches, namely the Half Moon Beach and Om Beach. Visitors need to hire a motor boat from either of the above-stated beaches to reach the Paradise Beach. This beach can also be reached after a small hike from the Half Moon Beach. Via this route, it will not take you more than 20 minutes to reach. Paradise Beach was earlier known as the hot spot for all the hippies, due to the trade of weed going on here. As soon as this caught the eye of the Government authorities, all these antisocial activities were curbed, shacks were broken, and all kinds of commercial activities were prohibited here. During the night time, you can often spot small troops of foreign travellers staying here, camping and cooking their meals. Availability of fresh water well on the beach makes it an ideal spot for camping. The water from this well is clean and safe for drinking. Swimming is highly enjoyable here but swimming far across the shore is risky due to the presence of very strong currents. Visitors can enjoy local cuisine in the nearby localities as well.

    <h1>Kudle beach</h1>
    <div class="kudle pimg"></div>

A complete recluse, this beach offers the most silent and serene atmosphere to enjoy a sunset, a walk along the shore or simply sit and observe the never-ceasing tides. Many local people prefer this beach for a morning or evening walk or practising yoga, as the Kudle beach is not invaded by large groups of tourists and as a result, has a very little crowd and quite serene. The beach is usually deserted, except for the peak months from November to February, when it is flocked by foreign travellers and backpackers who choose Kudle beach for its privacy. The sea is calm and shallow enough to have a bath or simply for dipping your feet, but it is always better to be careful. If you are planning to stay here overnight, there are a few proper hotels, which tend to be full during the peak seasons. However, from around October to March, the local people also put up temporary shacks and huts for makeshift accommodation and food. They are not the best option, but an option nevertheless. If you are of the adventurous type a night spent on the beach in a small hut listening to the sound of the waves is as perfect as it can get.
